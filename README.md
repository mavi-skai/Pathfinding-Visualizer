# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to my Pathfinding Visualizer! This project was created out of my passion for learning pathfinding algorithms. To enhance my understanding of these concepts, I built a visualizer to provide a more interactive learning experience. I hope you have fun exploring and experimenting with this visualization tool.


you can access it here: https://maveylencio.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/

Five pathfinding algorithm used in this application are:

- Breadth-first-search
- Depth-first search
- Dijkstra’s algorithm
- A* algorithm
- Greedy best-first search algorithm

Maze generation and Patterns include:

- Randomized prim’s algorithm
- Diagonal 
- Spiral
