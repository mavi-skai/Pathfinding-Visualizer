# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to my Pathfinding Visualizer! This project was built based on my interest for learning pathfinding algorithm and  
I decided I would do so by building a visualizer to help me better understand the concepts. I hope that  you enjoy playing
around with this visualization. 


you can access it here: https://maveylencio.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/

Five pathfinding algorithm used in this application are:

- Breadth-first-search
- Depth-first search
- Dijkstra’s algorithm
- A* algorithm
- Greedy best-first search algorithm

Maze generation and Patterns include:

- Randomized prim’s algorithm
- Diagonal (Matrix Traversal)
- Spiral	(Matrix Traversal)
